# logorithms pptx

all the code for the seminar i did on logorithms entirely written in python using the manim frameworkto create the videos and my pptx_export lib to convert each self.play call to a single slide which is modified from [this repo's implementation](https://github.com/yoshiask/manim-pptx) for python 3.7 and an older version of manim.
